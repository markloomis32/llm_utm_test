# llm_utm_test

This codebase was created to demonstrate a very basic shiny app that interacts with an LLM.  The app uses R's ellmer pacakge, Shiny and Gemini. 

I created the code after attending Joe Cheng's Posit Ellmer/LLM [Workflow Webinar] (https://github.com/jcheng5/workflow-demo/blob/main/index.qmd)
